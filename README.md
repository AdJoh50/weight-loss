Weight Loss Tip 12 How Starving Your Body Can Make You Gain Weight No, that title is not a typo.   One of the things that makes people not get the weight loss results that they want is that they may occasionally be starving their bodies.   There are two basic ways that this can happen. One is for it to be done inadvertently—like when you just get busy and forget to eat.   Another is when you purposely deprive your body of food to try and “speed up” your results.   Regardless of how it happens, either scenario in this case is equally damaging. Although you will decrease the calories that you take in which may lead to some short-term weight loss, the kicker here is that you will be slowing down your metabolism.   What this means is that after the starving is over, your body will hold onto the next meal you eat for dear life, expecting to be starved again.   If you allow starvation to become a habit, you will actually be contributing to your own weight gain in the future.   Therefore, make sure that you are keeping your meals no more than 4 hours apart. As long as you do this, you will be supporting the healthy metabolism that you’ll need to lose the kind of weight that you’ve committed to.
